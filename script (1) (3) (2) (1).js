A radionuclide is a specific type of atom that is radioactive, but radioactivity is the broader term describing the process. Reactive refers to a substance's tendency to participate in chemical reactions, while electropositive refers to an element's tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. Neither of these concepts relates directly to spontaneous nuclear decay."

The equilibrium expression is Kₚ = (P(HI))² / (P(H₂) × P(I₂)). Convert moles to partial pressures (PV=nRT) assuming ideal gas behavior.

        correct: 2,
       explanation: "Cell removal in early development can have different effects depending on whether the organism's cells are determinate (fate is fixed) or indeterminate (fate is flexible). In determinate species, cell removal usually prevents normal development, whereas in indeterminate species, the remaining cells can compensate."

        correct: 2,
        explanation: "If a fertilized egg divides to form a mass of blastomeres with different sizes and the cleavage is incomplete, this suggests the egg has a large amount of yolk that hinders full division. This type of cleavage is called meroblastic cleavage, where the division is only partial due to the presence of a large yolk mass.

        explanation: "According to Hund's rule, electrons will individually occupy each orbital within a subshell before doubling up in any one orbital. Group 16 elements have a p⁴ configuration, meaning they have four electrons in the p subshell. These will fill as follows: first, each p orbital receives one electron (nPx¹, nPy¹, nPz¹), and then one of them gets a second electron (nPx²). It is important to note that all electrons in the p subshell must first occupy all orbital with the same spin before pairing with opposite spin. nPx², nPy¹, nPz¹ describes the electronic configuration. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers, meaning electrons will have opposite spin in the same orbital. The correct explanation is Hund's and Pauli Exclusion principle, thus option (c) is the correct one. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle does not apply to the filling of orbitals and also Aufbau principle is not the key rule in this case."

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "We can solve this using an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Since Kp is given and we have the initial moles, we can set up an expression and solve it. The equilibrium expression is Kₚ = (P(HI))² / (P(H₂) × P(I₂)). Convert moles to partial pressures (PV=nRT) assuming ideal gas behavior. Since the volumes are the same, the mole ratios can be used directly in place of pressure ratio in the expression. Solve the resulting quadratic equation. The resulting moles of HI at equilibrium will be approximately 0.0780 mol."

    options: ["Addition of a catalyst", "Increasing the volume of the container", "Increasing the pressure by injecting PCl₅(g)", "Decreasing the temperature"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium shifts the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas. Since there are more moles of gas on the product side (2 vs 1), increasing the volume will increase the number of moles of Cl₂(g). A catalyst only changes reaction rate, not equilibrium position. Increasing pressure favors the side with fewer moles, and decreasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left (exothermic)."
